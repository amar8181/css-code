        Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) is a small woody plant native to India and North Africa. Its root and berries
        are used to produce a very popular Ayurvedic remedy (2Trusted Source).
        It’s considered an adaptogen, which means that it’s believed to help your body manage stress more effectively.
        Research has shown that it reduces levels of cortisol, a hormone that your adrenal glands produce in response to
        stress
